# ISMS-DOC-A08-2 Information Classification Procedure

## 1 Introduction

Information can take many forms including, but not limited to, the following:

- Hard copy data held on paper
- Data stored electronically in computer systems
- Communications sent by physical post or using email
- Data stored using electronic media such as USB drives, disks and tapes

Personal information is any information about any living, identifiable individual. The organization is legally responsible for this and its storage, protection and use are governed by national and international law. Details of specific requirements for personal information can be found in the Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policy.

The organization maintains inventories of all-important information assets upon which it relies. However, Swifty Global recognises that there are risks associated with employees, customers, contractors and other third parties accessing and handling information in order to conduct official organization business.

Swifty Global has a responsibility to protect the information it holds and processes using controls appropriate to the sensitivity of the information involved.

Only by classifying information according to a documented scheme can the correct level of protection be applied. This procedure sets out the details of the scheme to be adopted and the criteria applied in deciding which level of protection to apply to any given information asset.

This control applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the organization's information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers and other third parties who have access to Swifty Global systems.

## 2 Information Classification Procedure

On creation, all information assets must be assessed and classified by the owner according to their content. The classification will determine how the document should be protected and who should be allowed access to it. Any system subsequently allowing access to this information should clearly indicate the classification.

### 2.1 Classification Scheme

The Swifty Global information classification scheme requires information assets to be protectively marked into one of 3 classifications (excluding Public information which does not need to be marked). The way the document is handled, published, moved and stored will be dependent on this scheme.

The classes of information are:

- Level 0: Public (or unclassified)
- Level 1: Internal Use Only
- Level 2: Restricted
- Level 3: Confidential

The definitions of these classes of information are described in further detail below. The decision regarding which classification an information asset should fall into is based on the following main criteria:

1. Legal requirements that must be complied with
2. Value to the organization
3. Criticality to the organization
4. Sensitivity to unauthorised disclosure or modification

These areas are considered in the definitions below.

#### 2.1.1 Public/Unclassified Information Assets

Much of the information held by the organization is freely available to the public via established publication methods. Such items of information have no classification and will not be assigned a formal owner or inventoried.

It may be necessary however to maintain an awareness of the information that falls within this classification over time as circumstances may change and a need to provide increased protection of previously public information assets may arise.

#### 2.1.2 Internal Use Only

For information that is not published freely by the organization, some of this may be classified as Internal Use. This is typically information, which is relatively private in nature, either to an individual or to the organization and, whilst its loss or disclosure is unlikely to result in significant consequences, it would be undesirable.

Examples of this may include invoices, expense claims.

The criteria for assessing whether information would be classified as Protected include whether its unauthorised disclosure would:

- Cause distress to individuals
- Breach proper undertakings to maintain the confidence of information provided by third parties
- Breach statutory restrictions on the disclosure of information
- Cause financial loss or loss of earning potential, or to facilitate improper gain
- Give an unfair advantage to individuals or companies
- Prejudice the investigation or facilitate the commission of crime
- Disadvantage the organization in commercial or policy negotiations with others

Most employees of the organization are likely to handle "Internal Use" information during their working day.

#### 2.1.3 Restricted Information Assets

The level above Protected is that of Restricted. This information would be more serious if it were disclosed to unauthorised persons and result in significant embarrassment to the organization and possibly legal consequences.

Examples of this may include customer information, betting history, contracts.

The criteria for assessing whether information would be classified as Restricted include whether its unauthorised disclosure would:

- Affect relations with other organizations adversely
- Cause substantial distress to individuals
- Cause financial loss or loss of earning potential or to facilitate improper gain or advantage for individuals or companies
- Prejudice the investigation or facilitate the commission of crime
- Breach proper undertakings to maintain the confidence of information provided by third parties
- Impede the effective development or operation of organizational policies
- Breach statutory restrictions on disclosure of information
- Disadvantage the organization in commercial or policy negotiations with others
- Undermine the proper management of the organization and its operations

Information falling into the classification of "Restricted" will typically be handled by middle management and above, with some employees of lower clearance being given access only in specific circumstances.

#### 2.1.4 Confidential Information Assets

The highest level of classification is that of Confidential. This is reserved for information which is highly sensitive and would cause major reputation and financial loss if it were lost or wrongly disclosed.

Examples of this may include financial accounts, pre-launch product information, customer card details.

The criteria for assessing whether information would be classified as Confidential include whether its unauthorised disclosure would:

- Materially damage relations with other organizations (i.e. cause formal protest or other sanction)
- Prejudice individual security or liberty
- Cause damage to the operational effectiveness or security of the organization
- Work substantially against organizational finances or economic and commercial interests
- Substantially undermine the financial viability of major organizations
- Impede the investigation or facilitate the commission of serious crime
- Impede seriously the development or operation of organizational policies
- Shut down or otherwise substantially disrupt significant business operations

Access to information assets defined as "Confidential" will be tightly controlled by senior management and in many cases numbered copies of documents will be distributed according to specific procedures.

### 2.2 Deciding the Correct Classification

When deciding which classification to use for an information asset, it is recommended that an assessment is conducted to consider the likely impact if the asset were to be compromised. The criteria given in section 3 should be used for this purpose.

A correct classification will ensure that only genuinely sensitive information is subject to additional controls. The following points should be considered when assessing the classification to use:

- Applying too high a classification can inhibit access, lead to unnecessary and expensive protective controls, and impair the efficiency of the organization's business.
- Applying too low a classification may lead to damaging consequences and compromise of the asset.
- The compromise of larger sets of information of the same classification is likely to have a higher impact (particularly in relation to personal data) than that of a single instance. Generally this will not result in a higher classification but may require additional handling arrangements. However, if the accumulation of that data results in a more sensitive asset being created, then a higher classification should be considered.
- The sensitivity of an asset may change over time and it may be necessary to reclassify assets. If a document is being de-classified or the marking changed, the file should also be changed to reflect the highest marking within it.

Please see the Information Labelling Procedure for details of how information of the various classifications will be managed.
