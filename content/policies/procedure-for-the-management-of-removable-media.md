# ISMS-DOC-A08-5 Procedure for the Management of Removable Media

## 1 Introduction

As part of compliance with the Swifty Global information security policy, there may be circumstances where removable media will need to be used in order to store classified information. This document sets out how this should be done and what information should be recorded about the removable media and the user before it is issued.

The use of removable media such as USB memory sticks, CDs, DVDs and storage cards to store Swifty Global data represents a significant risk to the organization and is strictly controlled under the information security policy.

Where removable media is currently being used in a business process, consideration must be given to the best method of achieving that business process by another means.

This document provides procedures for the issuing of removable media in accordance with Swifty Global policy.

This control applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the organization's information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers and other third parties who have access to Swifty Global systems.

The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document:

- Asset Management Policy
- Information Classification Procedure
- Information Labelling Procedure
- Asset Handling Procedure
- Backup Policy
- Teleworking Policy
- Procedure for the Disposal of Media

## 2 Removable Media Management Procedure

The following procedure should be used in those circumstances where removable media is requested for legitimate business purposes in accordance with the Asset Management Policy.

### 2.1 User Request is Received

The request for removable media should be received by the IT Support Desk via one of the standard methods (telephone, email, self-service etc.). The requesting user will then be asked to complete a form detailing the business reason for requesting removable media and, upon receipt, the request will be logged in the service desk system with the completed form attached.

The IT Support Desk will then determine whether the use of removable media is the most appropriate method of achieving the business purpose that the user has. If the request for removable media is approved, then the rest of this procedure should be followed.

### 2.2 Order New or Allocate Existing Removable Media

If there are any new or re-usable removable media in stock these should be used in preference to ordering new. Re-used removable media must be wiped of any existing data.

There is a password-protected spreadsheet that holds the following information about issued removable media:

- Asset Number
- Serial Number
- Password
- Allocated User
- Date of issue

Open this spreadsheet and create a new line for new removable media or find the correct line for re-issued removable media.

### 2.3 Set Removable Media Password

If appropriate to the type of removable media allocated, a password should be set. This must be at least 8 characters, have at least one capital letter and include a number. See the user manual for details on how to do this.

### 2.4 Record Information in Spreadsheet

Add the name of the allocated user to the spreadsheet and the date the removable media was issued. Ensure the following information is also recorded:

- Asset number
- Serial number
- Password
- Date of Issue

### 2.5 Inform User of Key Facts

Email the user that has requested the removable media. If several have been requested each person must be individually contacted.

Make them aware that:

- The removable media is fully encrypted – ALL data on it will be encrypted
- The data will not be accessible without the password
- If the password is lost, the data will NOT be recoverable
- Do not write the password down or keep it with the removable media
- You are advised not to change the password because if you do the IT Support Desk will not be able to help you if you forget it
- The IT Support Desk must be informed if the removable media is lost

Email confirmation that they have read and understood the above must be obtained before the removable media is sent out. The confirmation email should be saved on the IT Sharepoint folder.

### 2.6 Send Removable Media to User

The removable media should be taken or sent to the user by internal post or delivered by hand. The password must not be included.

### 2.7 Provide User with Password in a Secure Way

The password should be provided to the user by phone call once they have received the removable media and their identity has been verified.
