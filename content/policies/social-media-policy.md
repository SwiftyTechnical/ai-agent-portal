# ISMS-DOC-A05-5 Social Media Policy

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to set out the organization's policy in the area of social media.

Swifty Global makes extensive use of social media to communicate directly with our customers as part of our marketing activity, to provide support for our products and services, and to obtain useful feedback on how our organization is perceived.

The social media landscape is constantly changing, but currently includes platforms such as the following:

- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- Instagram
- WhatsApp
- YouTube
- Pinterest
- Tumblr
- Blogging platforms

The appropriate use of social media can be challenging but is increasingly necessary, as it is often seen as a significant part of modern-day life. This communication method presents strong opportunities to get closer to our customers, but also represents a major risk if it is not used in a considered way, as an inappropriately worded message can cause offense and be passed on to many more people within a very short space of time.

This policy sets out guidelines for how organization-controlled social media accounts should be used and offers basic advice for the appropriate use of personal accounts outside of the work environment.

The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document:

- Acceptable Use Policy
- Electronic Messaging Policy
- Mobile Device Policy
- Software Policy
- Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policy

## 2 Policy

### 2.1 Corporate use of social media

You must be authorised to use the social media account and to represent Swifty Global to the general public as part of your job role.

Only authorised accounts should be used to publish messages and respond to other users of the social media channel. Do not use your own personal account.

When posting or engaging with other users, always make it clear that you work for Swifty Global and are representing us as an organization. Never pretend to be someone you're not.

Be careful what information you share online about customers, other employees, financial information, business operations or anything else that might be considered to be private or confidential.

Be careful when re-communicating others' posts. Attribute where appropriate and be aware of any potential copyright or other intellectual property issues.

Always check your facts before posting and correct any mistakes as soon as possible and in a clear and transparent way.

Remain friendly, respectful and professional and avoid using wording or styles (such as capitals) that might cause offence.

Consider the global nature of social media and be mindful of the fact that a statement may be interpreted in different ways in different countries or cultures around the world.

Avoid commenting on any matters that might be subject to a legal action either by or against the organization.

In an emergency or crisis, ensure that you communicate with the people within Swifty Global responsible for managing the situation, and follow their guidance.

### 2.2 Personal use of social media

Swifty Global respects your personal online activity as a medium of self-expression, but remember you continue to have responsibilities to the organization outside of working hours.

When using social media to engage on matters relevant to Swifty Global, make it clear it's your own opinion you are expressing and not that of the organization.

Remember you are not communicating on behalf of the organization. The other person may need an official response and it may be appropriate for you to refer them to our authorised channels.

Use separate accounts for personal and work-related use and try not to confuse the two.

Be aware that data protection and other Swifty Global policies still apply to your personal use of social media and that many platforms must be considered to be public forums.

Be careful about the personal information about yourself you share online and be mindful that the other person may not be who they say they are.

Swifty Global encourages you to express any concerns about employment-related issues through the appropriate channels within Swifty Global in the first instance e.g. your line manager or HR.
