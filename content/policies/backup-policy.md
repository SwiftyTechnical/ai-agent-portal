# ISMS-DOC-A12-5 Backup Policy

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to set out the way in which backups of information, software and system images are carried out, including regular testing.

Swifty Global invests a significant amount of resources in collecting, processing and managing information about all aspects of its business operations, including customers, suppliers, employees, legal and financial. In order to ensure the integrity and availability of this information it is essential that a sound backup policy is adopted which takes due account of the classification of the information involved.

Without complete and usable backups, the organization is exposed to an unacceptable level of risk and may be subject to significant legal consequences.

This document should be read in conjunction with the organization's business continuity plans which deal with how backups are used to restore data in the event of a disaster, and the following additional documents:

- Information Classification Procedure
- Capacity plan
- Information Labelling Procedure
- Asset Handling Procedure

This control applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the organization's information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers and other third parties who have access to Swifty Global systems.

## 2 Backup Policy

Regular backups of essential business information must be taken to ensure that the organization can recover from a disaster, media failure or other form of error.

An appropriate backup cycle must be designed and used that meets business requirements, complies with Swifty Global information security policy and is fully documented. Third parties that store organization information must also be required to ensure that the information is backed up appropriately.

In a cloud environment where the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for backups, the following criteria must be defined and agreed:

- Scope, schedule and location of backups
- Backup methods and data formats
- Retention periods for backups
- How the integrity of backups will be verified
- Restoration and testing procedures, including restoration timescales during a disruptive event
- Use of encryption
- How backups are segregated in a multi-tenant cloud environment
- Frequency and method of reviews of backup and recovery procedures

For backups under Swifty Global control, full documentation, including a complete record of what has been backed up must be stored in multiple regions.

Swifty Global does not use physical or "off-site backups". All data is cloud based and is stored in multi regions.

Full documentation of the recovery procedure associated with each backup must be created and stored.

Regular restores of information from back up media must be performed to verify the reliability, accuracy and integrity of the back-up media and the restore process.

Removable media (e.g. external drives) must be protected in accordance with the Swifty Global Asset Handling Procedure to prevent damage, theft or unauthorised access.

Storage media being stored or transported must be protected from unauthorised access, misuse or corruption in accordance with the relevant Physical Media Transport Procedure. Where couriers are required a list of reliable and trusted couriers should be established. If appropriate, physical controls such as encryption or special locked containers must also be used.

System documentation must be protected from unauthorised access (this does not include generic manuals that have been supplied with software). Effective version control must be applied to all documentation and its storage.

Storage media that is no longer required must be disposed of safely and securely as specified in the document Procedure for the Management of Removable Media to avoid data leakage, particularly where personally identifiable information (PII) is involved.

Appropriate arrangements must be put in place to ensure future availability of data that is required beyond the lifetime of the backup media.
