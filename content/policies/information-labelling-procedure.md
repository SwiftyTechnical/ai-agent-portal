# ISMS-DOC-A08-3 Information Labelling Procedure

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to set out how information assets will be labelled according to the information classification scheme in place within Swifty Global. For details of the scheme used and the criteria for classifying information assets, please see the Information Classification Procedure.

The labelling of information assets is a key control which will allow the appropriate level of protection to be applied. Unless information is clearly marked, employees and third parties cannot know whether the information is sensitive or not, particularly as this can change over time.

It is a responsibility of everyone involved in the organization to carefully consider how the information they produce, handle and dispose of can always remain effectively labelled.

The disclosure of classified information to an unauthorised person is a disciplinary offence. If there is suspicion that such information has been communicated in a way that could be harmful to the organization or to the data subject, then it is be reported in accordance with the organization's information security incident management procedures.

This control applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the organization's information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers and other third parties who have access to Swifty Global systems.

The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document:

- Information Classification Procedure
- Asset Handling Procedure

## 2 Information Labelling Procedure

In order to ensure that the correct controls are applied to the information assets of the organization, a system of protective marking will be used so that all employees and third parties (where applicable) are aware of how that information must be managed.

### 2.1 Designation of Devices

All company-owned devices, including but not limited to computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and any other electronic devices, are hereby designated as "Internal Use Only." This designation is to be strictly adhered to by all employees and staff members.

### 2.2 Printed Reports

Where possible, a printout of information that carries a security classification will display the security marking, clearly visible on every page of the document. Where this is not possible, one of the following methods will be used:

1. The classification will be shown clearly on the front page and in the header of every subsequent page
2. Pre-printed paper showing the security classification will be used
3. A stamp will be used to mark each page with the security classification

It is expected that the clearest and least labour-intensive method will be selected in each case.

### 2.3 Screen Displays

Computer systems which allow an authorised user access to classified information will include a warning of this fact upon logon which requires user acknowledgement of some form. Where feasible, users should also be warned upon entering an area of the system which contains a higher classification of information than most other areas.

The company may also use other messaging to show the classification of documents. These may include:

1. Use classification on the top-level folders to indicate the type of files within that folder.
2. Within the filename of the document.

Further warnings should also be displayed upon entering the options to print or save data from these areas of the system.

### 2.4 Recorded Media

Strict controls are placed on the use of removable media such as CDs, DVDs, tapes, external hard drives and USB memory sticks within the organization. Where these are legitimately used to store classified data, they will be labelled externally with the security classification of the most sensitive data on the media, together with the date of creation.

### 2.5 Electronic Messages

Classified information sent within emails must include the classification level and, if being sent externally, a statement of the controls that must be placed on the information by the recipient of the email. Where the information is contained within an attachment, this must also state the classification clearly at the header of the document, spreadsheet or other type of file.

### 2.6 File Transfers

Procedures for classified information sent via file transfer must include a step in which the recipient is clearly informed of the classification level of the information being transmitted, before it is sent.
