Your Internet access must be used in accordance with this policy for tasks reasonably related to your work including:

- Access to information and systems that is pertinent to fulfilling the organization's business obligations
- The capability to post updates to organization-owned and/or maintained web sites and social media accounts
- An electronic commerce facility (e.g. purchasing equipment for the organization)

### 2.2 Personal use of the Internet

The organization permits personal use of the Internet in your own time (for example during your lunch-break), provided it does not interfere with your work. Any exception to this is at the discretion of your line manager.

The organization is not, however, responsible for any personal transactions you enter - for example in respect of the quality, delivery or loss of items ordered. You must accept responsibility for, and keep the organization protected against, any claims, damages, losses or the like which might arise from your transaction - for example in relation to payment for the items or any personal injury or damage to property they might cause.

If you purchase personal goods or services via the Internet service, you are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide shows that the transaction is being entered by you personally and not on behalf of the organization.

You must ensure that personal goods and services purchased are delivered to your home or other personal address and not delivered to organization property.

If you are in any doubt about how you may make personal use of the Internet service, you are advised not to do so.

All personal usage must be in accordance with this policy. Your computer and company-provided mobile devices and any data held on them are the property of the organization and may be accessed at any time by the organization to ensure compliance with all its statutory, regulatory and internal policy requirements.

### 2.3 Internet access, security and monitoring

The organization will provide secure access to the Internet from your business device e.g. desktop computer or laptop. The IT Service Provider is responsible for the technical management of this access.

You are responsible for the security provided by your account username and password. Only you must know your password and you must be the only person who uses the Internet whilst logged on with your account.

You must not use anyone else's user account to access the Internet.

The provision of Internet access is owned by the organization and all access is recorded, logged and interrogated for the purposes of:
