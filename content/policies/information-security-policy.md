# ISMS-DOC-05-4 Information Security Policy

## 1 Introduction

This document defines the information security policy of Swifty Global.

As a modern, forward-looking business, Swifty Global recognises at senior levels the need to ensure that its business operates smoothly and without interruption for the benefit of its customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.

In order to provide such a level of continuous operation, Swifty Global has implemented an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in line with the International Standard for Information Security, ISO/IEC 27001. This standard defines the requirements for an ISMS based on internationally recognised best practice.

The operation of the ISMS has many benefits for the business, including:

- Protection of revenue streams and company profitability
- Ensuring the supply of goods and services to customers
- Maintenance and enhancement of shareholder value
- Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements

Swifty Global has decided to maintain part certification to ISO/IEC 27001 in order that the effective adoption of information security best practice may be validated by an independent third party, a Registered Certification Body (RCB). In addition, the guidance contained in the codes of practice ISO/IEC 27017 and ISO/IEC 27018 has been adopted as these have particular relevance for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

This policy applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the organization's information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers and other third parties who have access to Swifty Global systems.

## 2 Information security policy

### 2.1 Information security requirements

A clear definition of the requirements for information security within Swifty Global will be agreed and maintained with the internal business and cloud service customers so that all ISMS activity is focussed on the fulfilment of those requirements. Statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements will also be documented and input to the planning process. Specific requirements about the security of new or changed systems or services will be captured as part of the design stage of each project.

It is a fundamental principle of the Swifty Global Information Security Management System that the controls implemented are driven by business needs and this will be regularly communicated to all staff through team meetings and briefing documents.

### 2.2 Framework for setting objectives

A regular cycle will be used for the setting of objectives for information security, to coincide with the budget planning cycle. This will ensure that adequate funding is obtained for the improvement activities identified. These objectives will be based upon a clear understanding of the business requirements, informed by the management review process during which the views of relevant interested parties may be obtained.

Information security objectives will be documented for an agreed time period, together with details of how they will be achieved. These will be evaluated and monitored as part of management reviews to ensure that they remain valid. If amendments are required, these will be managed through the change management process.

In accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 the reference controls detailed in Annex A of the standard will be adopted where appropriate by Swifty Global. These will be reviewed on a regular basis in the light of the outcome from risk assessments and in line with information security risk treatment plans. For details of which Annex A controls have been implemented and which have been excluded please see the Statement of Applicability.

In addition, enhanced and additional controls from the following codes of practice will be adopted and implemented where appropriate:

- ISO/IEC 27002 – Code of practice for information security controls
- ISO/IEC 27017 – Code of practice for information security controls based on ISO/IEC 27002 for cloud services
- ISO/IEC 27018 – Code of practice for protection of personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors

The adoption of these codes of practice will provide additional assurance to our customers and help further with our compliance with international data protection legislation.

### 2.3 Continual improvement of the ISMS

Swifty Global policy regarding continual improvement is to:

- Continually improve the effectiveness of the ISMS
- Enhance current processes to bring them into line with good practice as defined within ISO/IEC 27001 and related standards
- Achieve ISO/IEC 27001 certification and maintain it on an on-going basis
- Increase the level of proactivity (and the stakeholder perception of proactivity) with regard to information security
- Make information security processes and controls more measurable in order to provide a sound basis for informed decisions
- Review relevant metrics on an annual basis to assess whether it is appropriate to change them, based on collected historical data
- Obtain ideas for improvement via regular meetings and other forms of communication with interested parties, including cloud service customers
- Review ideas for improvement at regular management meetings in order to prioritise and assess timescales and benefits

Ideas for improvements may be obtained from any source including employees, customers, suppliers, IT staff, risk assessments and service reports. Once identified they will be recorded and evaluated as part of management reviews.
