# ISMS-DOC-A08-9 Procedure for the Disposal of Media

## 1 Introduction

The use of media such as USB memory sticks, CDs, DVDs and storage cards to store Swifty Global data represents a significant risk to the organization and is strictly controlled under the information security policy.

Where media is currently being used in a business process, consideration must be given to the best method of achieving that business process by another means.

However, there may remain legitimate business uses of media such as computer hard disks that require that they are disposed of in a secure way, to prevent data leakage and compromise.

This document provides procedures for the disposal of media in accordance with Swifty Global policy.

This control applies to all systems, people and processes that constitute the organization's information systems, including board members, directors, employees, suppliers and other third parties who have access to Swifty Global systems.

The following policies and procedures are relevant to this document:

## 2 Procedure for the Disposal of Media

### 2.1 Requesting Secure Disposal

Requests to securely dispose of media should be logged with the IT Support Desk via telephone, email or online. It is the responsibility of the owner of the media to inform the IT Support Desk of the need to dispose of the media.

The following details should be provided:

- Requester name, role, department and contact details
- The type of media to be disposed of
- Serial number of the media and/or device containing the media (e.g. PC), if available
- The classification of the information held on the media if known
- The location of the media
- The reason for the media needing to be disposed of
- When the media will be available for collection

Note that it is the responsibility of the owner of the device or media to ensure that any required backups have been made of the data prior to requesting disposal. Once collected from site by the IT Support Desk data cannot be recovered.

### 2.2 Media Collection and Transport

The IT Support Desk will then arrange for the media to be collected via a secure means appropriate to the classification of the information held on it. In the meantime, the media should be protected appropriately prior to collection.

It may be appropriate to delay collection until a bulk pickup can be organised e.g. in the case of an office closure where many PCs are to be disposed of. Delayed collection should only be scheduled where the media can continue to be securely stored.

### 2.3 Confirm Details Provided

Once received from the requester the details of the media should be checked against those provided to verify accuracy and completeness. For multiple disposals, an inventory of kit should be compiled with the following details:

- Device manufacturer, make and model
- Serial number
- Source
- Date of receipt

For individual requests this information may be stored on the service desk record raised at the time of the disposal request. The hardware asset register should be updated to reflect the fact that the device is no longer in live use and is pending disposal. Whilst awaiting disposal the equipment must be stored securely to prevent unauthorised access.

### 2.4 Choose Disposal Method

According to the type of media and the contractual arrangements in place with third parties, the IT Support Desk will then decide how best to dispose of the media.

#### 2.4.1 Local Disposal

Where available, local facilities will be used to securely dispose of certain types of media. Media that may be locally disposed of may include:

- USB memory sticks
- Hard disks
- CDs and DVDs
- Solid state storage devices
- Floppy disks
- Phones and tablets

Only approved equipment e.g. a disk shredder may be used for local disposal.

#### 2.4.2 Using a Third Party

For devices and media that require specialist equipment to securely destroy them a third party may be used.

Third party can be found in the supplier register.

The IT Support Desk should contact the third party to arrange a date and time for collection. Collection from site may also be an option to avoid the need to transport the kit more than necessary. The inventory of equipment being collected should be checked and confirmed before leaving site so that all records are correct and up to date.

### 2.5 Disposal

The devices or media will then be disposed of using the chosen method. For local disposal, destruction should be witnessed by more than one person and the names of the people involved recorded.

For secure disposal using a third party the contractor will issue a certificate of disposal that complies with applicable legislation. The IT Support Desk will keep a record of these certificates.

Where appropriate, some of the equipment (or components of it) may be recycled in accordance with applicable legislation.

### 2.6 Record Disposal and Close Request

Once successfully disposed of, the request record should be updated with the date, time and method of disposal and closed.

The hardware asset register should also be updated to reflect the fact that the equipment has been securely destroyed.
